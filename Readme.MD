## 1. Project Goals

1. Track a ball in a video without using any opencv functions for contours 

2. Fitting a plane to Point Clouds
3. Performing Least Squares , Total Least Sqaures and RANSAC fitting.

## 2. Installation of Dependencies

* Opencv
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
## 3. Contents of Repo
* Code - contains the code 
* Source - the files given for doing operations 
* Report - report done for Project

## 3. Setting up the package

1. Clone the github repo.

```` 
$ git clone link-of-repo
````
2. After cloning, you will see  three folders.

3. Inside the code, there will be the py scripts.

4. Run the python code by
````
python nameoffile.py
````
## Future Work 

* Rework code to avoid runtime errors.

# Notes 
* The plots open in seperate windows. Press Q to close them when not needed.
* There are few RuntimeWarnings and DeprecationWarning that pop up which do not affect the running of the program nor the values the program gives out.
* The source data  of video and point files have to placed in the source directory.
